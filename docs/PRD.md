## Executive Summary

The Vulnerable Web Application is an intentionally insecure web application designed as an educational platform for teaching common security vulnerabilities through hands-on exploitation. Unlike theoretical learning, this platform enables students to exploit vulnerabilities in a working application to understand how real attacks operate and how to implement proper defenses.

The application contains a fully functional authentication system with 8 deliberately introduced security flaws, covering critical OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Built with FastAPI and SQLite, the codebase is simple enough to be read in a single session while being realistic enough to demonstrate actual attack techniques.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Practical Learning**: Exploit real vulnerabilities rather than studying theory
- **Complete Code Access**: Full source code visibility for root cause analysis
- **Safe Environment**: Controlled sandbox for ethical security education
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 8 major vulnerability types in a single application
- **Professional Presentation**: University-branded interface suitable for academic institutions

---

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional security education often focuses on theoretical knowledge without practical application. Students learn about SQL injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities through slides and documentation but never experience exploiting or defending against them in a real application environment.

### 1.2 Solution

A deliberately vulnerable web application that serves as a hands-on laboratory where students can:
1. Identify security vulnerabilities in source code
2. Exploit vulnerabilities using real attack vectors
3. Analyze root causes at the code level
4. Implement secure coding practices to mitigate each vulnerability

### 1.3 Scope

The product includes:
- User authentication system (signup, login, logout)
- Protected dashboard page
- 8 intentional security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive exploitation documentation
- Professional UI with university branding
- Database file download endpoint (intentional vulnerability)

Out of scope:
- User account management beyond signup/login
- Multi-factor authentication
- API endpoints for external integration
- Production deployment support
